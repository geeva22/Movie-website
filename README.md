# Movie-website
Usually, it can be an excited and interesting experience searching around at websites in particular industries to learn about the current trends and to study how they differ from those in other industries. In this project, we will have a clear idea about the websites of major motion pictures to see what types of websites are being created. Nowadays movies play a big part in the entertainment sector, and recently these movie websites have become increasingly important to their overall success. Movies are made to keep people entertained, and movie websites are created for the same reason. In order to attract visitors attention and to encourage them to watch a movie, a website needs to display all information on what they are looking for and keep them entertained as well. Present movie websites make it easy to take a couple minutes and watch a few trailers for all movies in a single page and thus allows to decide which movie to see. Usually many movie websites, doe not include more than just the movie it also provides information along with the trailer. At times, games and activities to entertain customers are also very common. Such elements can make the website more attractive or fun for visitors it also helps in promoting the movie.
